A new course that I would probably teach at might school would be sewable circuits. 
* In it students would learn 
  * How to sew
  * Basic circuits
  * Program the circuits to do what they want
  * be creative! 

Target audience is everyone but mainly 6th grade - but specifically, I have girls who are interested in coding, but this makes it more crafty. I have kids who are very tactile and this is better for them also because they can see and feel the fruits of their labors. 

This also works with a lot of the science curriculum around energy and electricity.
