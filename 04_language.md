  * Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
  * Answer the following prompts:
  # What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
    This might be for any of the 3 grades - 6-8
  # What is the language?
    SNAP
    
  # How does one write & run code in this language?
    SNAP is a block-based language 
 
 # Rate the complexity of the syntax?
    The is great for the beginner - especially kids of my students' ages where they haven't had much exposure to coding. 
 
 # Strengths
    * You can make custom functions that return values that can be used by other functions, which you cannot do in Scratch.
    * It's a simple interface with plenty of space to read your code 
    * Blocks make sure that correct values are used in the correct way. 
 
  # How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
    * I would have the students check their work by using the color coding of snap to make sure htey used the right blocks in the right ways for their desired outcome. 
    Depending on the skill level of the student I could encourage them to create their own functions and use the gathered output in other functions. 
  # Weaknesses
  * Unlike Scratch, the community for assistance seems smaller, as the Scratch community is rather robust. 
  * Some students have a recognition of Scratch as a language, but the overall similarity may mean that it's not really an issue. 
  # How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
  * I don't think this is something that would be TOO much of a problem THOUGH the fact that SNAP is a bit more robust in terms of CS standards makes it a bit better of a choice I think. 
  # Why did you select this language for this class?
  * I want my kids to have a more solid CS foundation EVEN THOUGH I am only getting their toes wet before HS. SNAP allows for the same creativity as Scratch, but may be a better patheay as they move on to HS.
