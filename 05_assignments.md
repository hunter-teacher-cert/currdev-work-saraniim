Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan. Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file. Save this file in your own personal work repository. This is individual work, that can be incorperated into your unit plan later.


# Introduction to P5 - Assignment One - UNPLUGGED
## Directions: Every good programmer knows what they are going to do before they do it. Today you will practice writing instructions on paper so that you know that you that the computer will understand what you mean when you program! You will use a graph and draw a design. THEN you have to write instructions so that ANOTHER PERSON could draw them. Remember to be clear! 
1. Draw something that uses ONLY ellipses and rectangles on your graph paper. 
  a. You can use a maximum of 5 shapes
  [draw sheet](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1B17Z3oj1XnFUKnnDfSTC219GOOBoAJgogwEHiUsHHsg/edit?usp=sharing)
  Reminder to put the center point of your ellipse at an intersection in the grid and that rectangles should be drawn along the lines of the grid.
2. Deconstruct your drawing into the shapes that you made using the following worksheet.
  a. [shapes instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LZwJ3P76dhPC77smRjKlMV3vKBSp6g0roo-7d2T4K0/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Now give JUST your instructions to a student at a different table and you will receive one as well. Recreate their drawing using their instructions. 
4. Trade back. Is it right? If not, where was the issue? WIth the programmer or the computer?

# P5 - Assignment 2 - Assignment 2 - PRactice
## You've now practiced both programming and following instructions so you know how to be clear! Let's see if you can deconstruct an image and recreate it using what you have learned. 
1. Take a look at this image: [composition](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16t2bzQr3or4NfCafuw2SVFyMpsWUDbcGpSKuyzZfD38/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Recreate it to your best ability. BUT without the color.
