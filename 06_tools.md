<H1>Tools
  <h2>Tool 1
    -Promethean Board
    -Purpose is to use for interactive board with students. Sometimes they come up sometimes just for display. Sometimes I have kids cast their work on it to share. I use it with all classes. I use it because I need to use a board, but it is also nice to be able to have kids share what they are doing and/or collaborate. 
    
  <h2> Tool 2
    -Codesters
    -It's for learning python. It's part of my curriculum and they can use the platform as a sandbox as well to free create. I chose it because they bridge the gap of block and text pretty nicely and make it visual while guiding and checking at the same time. The kids feel confident when using it and I am able to checkpoint them a lot as well as do multiple exit points.
